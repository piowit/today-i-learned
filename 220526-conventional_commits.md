I always wonder if my commit messages are good enough. With answer to my struggle comes Conventional Commits, which is specification on how to write commit messages. Additionaly when we are writing commits this way we can generate changelog easily.

example structure
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```
If we are working with VSCode i can also reccomend [Conventional Commits Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vivaxy.vscode-conventional-commits), that helps us create these beautiful Conventional Commits Messeges :D
